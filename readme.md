# CVE Hunter
## Usage
If you want to set cve-hunter in ``PATH`` variable (sort of), run ``chmod +x installer.sh`` to give the installer executable permissions
then, run ``./installer.sh``. The installer will give cve-hunter running premissions, and will copy the executable to ``/usr/bin`` so you can run the program everywhere, without using ``./``.


But if you want to simply test the program without any fancy installer scripts, run ``chmod +x cve-hunter`` to give it executable permissions and then run ``./cve-hunter (-p/r) (requirements.txt/package.json)``
and the program will run as intended.
## Testing
``requirements.txt`` and  ``package.json`` are testing files you can use in order to test the program, edit them all you want, im ready for everything ðŸ˜¼.


## Building 
If you want to change the source code and rebuild the executable, you are are going to need to use the python ``pyinstaller`` package, [perss here for the installation guide](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).

After installing ``pyinstaller``, run the following:

``pyinstaller --onefile cve-hunter.py`` - This will build the python file into an executable in the ``dist`` directory.

## Notes
used the OSV api
open source is crazy - all the others required api key (snyk/version-eye) and it was annoying and didnt work
then I stumbled upon pip-audit, and it mentioned using the OSV api - I gave it a try and wallah! works like a charm

## Running examples
Running these could get tricky, so there are some examples (note that im assuming the shell is opened in the project's root dir)

``chmod +x cve-hunter`` - to give executable permissions

``./cve-hunter -r requirements.txt`` - to run a python requirements file

``./cve-hunter -p package.json`` - to run a npm package json file
